    <h1>Eid al-Adha: The Feast of Sacrifice</h1>
    <p>Eid al-Adha, or the Feast of Sacrifice, is a major holiday celebrated by Muslims worldwide for three to four
        days. Most Muslims will attend the special prayers held at major mosques and Islamic centers in the United
        States and throughout the world. Muslims usually wear new clothes and some exchange gifts. Children take a day
        off from school (including college students), and many adults do not go to work. When asked about the origin of
        Eid al-Adha, The Prophet of Islam, Muhammad, is reported to have said, “It is a tradition that has come down to
        us from Abraham.” The Feast of Sacrifice originates from the historic event when Prophet Abraham was commanded
        by God in a dream vision to sacrifice his son, Ishmail. While he was in the act of sacrificing his son, God sent
        the Angel Gabriel with a huge ram. Gabriel informed Abraham that his dream vision was fulfilled and instructed
        him to sacrifice the ram as a ransom for his son. The story is mentioned in Chapter #37 of the Holy Qur'an. Eid
        al-Adha enjoys special significance because the Day of Sacrifice marks the climax of Hajj or Pilgrimage, the
        fifth pillar of Islam. This annual pilgrimage to Makkah and Madinah in Saudi Arabia is an obligation only for
        those men and women who are physically and financially able to perform it once in their lifetime.</p>
